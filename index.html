						<p>Hi I'm Steve Jones. I'm the CTO of Equalize Digital we're a certified B-Corporation and a WordPress VIP agency that specializes in accessibility.</p>

						<p>Today I'm excited to talk about how to implement an accessibility first approach into your WordPress development projects. This ensures a truly accessible digital experience for all users, specifically those with disabilities. We'll explore the unique responsibility WordPress developers have to take a proactive approach to developing blocks, plugins, and themes. As well as tools and automatons we can integrate into our development workflow.</p>

						<p>Here is what I want to be your main take away from this speech.</p>

						<p>Adopt and prioritize accessibility early, and often throughout your development workflow.</p>

					<h2>Prerequisite: Website Accessibility</h2>
					<p>An accessible website is usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their ability or circumstances.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I'm sure most of you are familiar at some level with website accessibility since you've turned up for an accessibility talk. But I want to start with a simple definition of accessibility so we're on the same page.</p>

						<p>Accessible website development is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible, regardless of their ability or circumstances.</p>

						<p></p>Traditionally people think of this as only those with disabilities. But making websites accessible also benefits those using mobile devices, slow internet connections, or temporary heath issues.</aside>

					<h2>Why Accessibility?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Legal requirements
							<br /><small>*I'm not a lawyer!</small>
						</li>
						<li>Everyone benefits from accessibility.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>There are many reasons why accessibility is important but I'll briefly cover just a couple.</p>
						
						<h3>Legal requirements</h3>
						
						<p>Many countries have legal accessibility requirements and penalties if you're found to not be following accessibility requirements. Disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, please consult your lawyer for legal advice. In the United States federal agencies and often those receiving federal grants are required to adhere to <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a> standards. Other businesses in the United States most adhere to the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> (ADA) I've personally been in conversations with people at WordCamps who were sued for violating accessibility requirements. Trust me it's better to do it right the first time then to get tangled up in costly litigation.</p>
						
						<h3>Everyone benefits from accessibility.</h3>

						<p>Accessibility benefits all users. If you develop features for users that are hard-of-hearing it will benefit users watching in loud places or with the audio turned off. If you develop features for users that are visually impaired it will benefit users the suffer from migraines and can't currently look at their screens.</p>

						<p>As much as we'd like to avoid it, we're all aging and will most likely some day benefit from accessibility ourselves either due to age related heath issues such as visual impairment or some more extreme health issues.</p>

						<p>Even though we may not realize it we all need accessibility. By adopting accessibility first development now well ensuring an accessible future.</p>

					<h2>What is Accessibility First Development?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>It's Necessary</li>
						<li>It's Inclusive</li>
						<li>It's Proactive</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Accessibility first development is a shift in the way you approach your thinking about the development process. Choosing to create blocks, plugins, and themes that are as accessible as possible out of the box.</p>
						<h3>It's necessary</h3>
						<p>Accessibility first development embarrassed the idea that accessibility is a necessity. It's not added later or worse ignored altogether if the project deadline is approaching. Prioritizing accessibility takes it from being a baseline standard to a core project requirement. Simple put, If it's not accessibility it doesn't work.</p>
						<h3>It's Inclusive</h3>
						<p>Accessibility first aims to target the users with the most severe disability. This creates a trickle down affect that covers all other users with little to no disabilities.</p>
						<h3>It's Proactive</h3>
						<p>Accessibility first development addresses inclusivity at the beginning and through out the development process, not as an afterthought. Addressing accessibility earlier saves time and resources when building blocks, plugins, and websites through a more efficient development workflow.</p>

					<h2>The WordPress Developers Accessibility Responsibility</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>WordPress powers over 40% of all website on the internet</li>
						<li>WordPress products are generally content producing</li>
						<li>Ensure blocks, plugins, and themes are fully accessible at launch</li>
						<li>Retroactive remediation can be daunting and expensive.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>WordPress developers have a unique responsibility to take a proactive approach to developing blocks, plugins, and themes that are fully accessible at launch. These products are generally content producing or duplicated on multiple websites. With WordPress' massive ~40% market share of websites, remedying accessibility issues retroactively can be a daunting in not impossible task.</p>

						<p>For example if you create and release a block plugin that generate HTML markup in the database that is inaccessible it could be installed on any number of websites and used on any number of pages. Release and update to fix that issues…</p>

					<h2>A Word of Caution</h2>
					<p>Be cautious of layered on one click accessibility solutions.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>There are some people out there that claim accessibility can be layered on top of an existing, inaccessible website. This is not true and these people are typically trying to sell you something. There is no replacement for making accessibility part of your development knowledge base from the onset.</p>

					<h2>We've Been Here Before - Mobile First Development</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Mobile first required a shift in thinking</li>
						<li>Mobile first required adjustments in development workflows</li>
						<li>Accessibility first development must become just as common place as mobile first development.</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Around 2009, we first heard about the Mobile First concept. It was an overwhelming shift in thinking and development workflows. Now it is just part of our daily lives as developers. I actually this it would be more work to make a website that isn't responsive at this point.</p>

						<p>Today the accessibility first concept may seem just as daunting as Mobile First did years ago. With the right tools and attitude Accessibility can become just as integral to our development workflow as Mobile First.</p>

					<h2>Learn Accessibility Deeply</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
							<br /><small><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag" aria-label="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag</a></small>
						</li>
						<li>
							MDN Web docs (Unofficial)
							<br /><small><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility" aria-label="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility</a></small>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) explain how to make web content more accessible.</p>
						<p>I find the MDN Web Docs to be a help place for developers to find details accessible documentation and examples. These are unofficial docs so alway be sure to cross reference these docs with the office WCAG guidelines.</p>

						<li><a href="https://www.siteimprove.com/">Siteimprove</a></li>
					</ul>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Automated testing can quickly identify accessibility issues and provide full site reports saving time and cost.

						Automation doesn't equal an accessible website. It just mean that you've made accessible anything that can be automated. Some issues must be tested manually.

					<h2>Keyboard</h2>
					<p>Use your keyboard to move through any interactive elements. Look for:</p>
					<ul class="r-stack">
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Ability to tab to any interactive element (buttons or links) with the tab key.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Nothing invisible or hidden (that you cannot see) gets focus.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Focus order follows the order of the page, left to right, top to bottom.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Visible focus outline (2px solid with a 2px offset) that sufficiently contrasts with the background (AAA color contrast).</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Buttons should be able to be triggered by the Enter/Return key or the space bar.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Links should be triggered by the Enter/Return key.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">If a button or link triggers a scroll or opens a modal, etc. the focus should shift to the scrolled-to area or into the modal.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">If a modal is opened, when it is closed, the focus should return to the button that triggered the modal to open.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Screen Readers</h2>
					<p>Use either NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) to listen to the element. Listen for:</p>
					<ul class="r-stack">
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Missing labels - anything that just says “button” or “link” but doesn't say what the button or link is or does.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Confusing or incorrect labels or alternative text. For example, a close button on a modal that just reads as “X” rather than “close modal.”</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Ambiguous labels that don't have meaning without the surrounding text, for example, “Read More”, “Download”, etc.</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Unnecessary clutter (multiple links in a row going to the same place, decorative icons next to linked text, etc.)</li>
					</ul>
